**things to improve**:
Due to the cursor position, I had to disable vertical scrolling. I need to find a better way to do this without disabling vertical scrolling altogether.
body {
overflow: hidden;
}
The CSS needs improvement. The transition between the typing box and the results box should be smooth.

I need to make the site responsive.
The feature for free typing should be added.
this issue of 'ل ا لا' displaying as a one letter should be solved
I also need to remove the spaghetti code from the JavaScript.
